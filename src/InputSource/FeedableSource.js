/**
 * FeedableSource — input source for the feed()/end() API.
 *
 * Accepts incremental string/Buffer chunks via feed(), accumulates them in a
 * single string buffer, and exposes the same read interface as StringSource so
 * Xml2JsParser can use it without modification.
 *
 * ### Incremental parsing
 *
 * The parser calls parseXml() after every feed() call, consuming as much of
 * the buffer as possible. When a chunk boundary falls mid-token (e.g. a CDATA
 * section split across two feeds), every reader function marks its start
 * position with markTokenStart() before it begins. If the reader throws
 * UNEXPECTED_END, the caller (XMLParser.feed) catches it and calls
 * rewindToMark() to restore startIndex to the beginning of the incomplete
 * token. The incomplete bytes stay in the buffer and are re-parsed on the
 * next feed() once the rest of the token has arrived.
 *
 * ### Two-level mark stack
 *
 * There are two mark levels:
 *
 *   Level 0 — outer mark, set by parseXml()'s main loop BEFORE it reads the
 *              '<' character that begins a tag dispatch. This is the position
 *              that rewindToMark() always restores to, so the full tag (including
 *              its '<![', '</', etc. prefix) is replayed correctly on the next
 *              feed().
 *
 *   Level 1 — inner mark, set by individual reader functions (readCdata,
 *              readClosingTagName, readTagExp, …) at the point where *they*
 *              begin. This does NOT affect rewindToMark(); it is used only by
 *              flush() to determine the safe trim boundary while a reader is
 *              in progress.
 *
 * Using two levels instead of a single slot prevents inner markTokenStart()
 * calls from overwriting the outer mark that feed() needs to rewind to.
 *
 * ### Memory
 *
 * Parsed data is reclaimed from the buffer automatically (autoFlush) once the
 * processed portion exceeds flushThreshold bytes. Because parseXml() runs per
 * chunk and completed tokens are consumed before the next chunk arrives, only
 * incomplete tokens at the current chunk boundary are retained — not the whole
 * document.
 *
 * maxBufferSize is checked against the live (unprocessed) portion of the
 * buffer plus the incoming chunk, not the raw buffer.length, so post-flush
 * sizing stays accurate.
